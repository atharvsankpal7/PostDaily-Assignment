# Streamlit Application Development Overview

## 1. Initial Setup
- Created a basic Streamlit application structure.
- Implemented news fetching functionality using DuckDuckGo search.

## 2. AI Integration
- Integrated Google's Gemini API for text summarization and precaution generation.
- Developed prompts to guide the AI in generating relevant and concise information.

## 3. Email Functionality

## 4. API Keys Security
- Securely saved the API keys in `.env` files.
- Used the `python-dotenv` library to access the keys.

## 5. Modularization
Separated the codebase into distinct modules:
- **main.py**: Core Streamlit application
- **news_fetcher.py**: News retrieval functionality
- **summarizer.py**: AI-powered summarization and precaution generation
- **email_sender.py**: Email composition and sending logic
- **email_template.py**: HTML and CSS for email formatting
- **config.py**: Configuration and API key management

## 6. Testing and Refinement
- Conducted thorough testing of each module.
- Refined AI prompts for better output quality.
- Improved error handling and user feedback.
